## Introduction

Supervised machine learning techniques make use of known samples to train a model, and then use this model to make predictions on new data. One of the best known ML libraries is [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html#), a package that provides efficient versions of a large number of well researched algorithms. A good introduction to machine learning and the scikit-learn API is available in [this excerpt from the Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.01-what-is-machine-learning.html). 

This SSE provides functions to train, test and evaluate models and then use these models to make predictions. The current implementation scope includes classification and regression algorithms.
