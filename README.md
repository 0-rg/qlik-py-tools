# qlik-py-tools
This repository provides a server side extension for Qlik Sense and QlikView built using Python. The intention is to provide a set of functions for data science that can be used as expressions in Qlik. 

The current implementation includes functions for:

- Time series forecasting : Implemented using Facebook Prophet, a modern and robust library for generating quality forecasts.
- Seasonality and holiday analysis: Also using Facebook Prophet.
- Linear correlations : Implemented using Pandas.

Further information on these can be found under [docs](docs).
